Unlimited Destruction
Levels:
-	Inside a house, the player will need to break everything using only a baseball. Once outside, the player will need to blow up the house and part of the Earth using a laser gun. Walking further into the nearby fields, the player will find a barn surrounded by four water towers. The player will need to destroy the barn and the water towers using the laser gun and cartoonish bomb projectiles.
-	Inside a parking garage, the player will need to destroy the surrounding cars using traffic cones and a disconnected muffler from one of the broken-down cars. After exiting the parking garage, the player will need to blow up the entire structure by targeting the supports with a cartoonish rocket launcher.
-	Starting near a small city, the player will need to get creative and use larger objects such as dislodged car tires, crowbars, and a cartoonish grenade launcher to destroy all the surrounding objects. Objects including mail deposit boxes, store fronts, and 4 large buildings will need to be destroyed by the end of the level.
-	On an alien planet, the player will need to use explosives to blow up the inside of an alien ship and parts of the planet’s landmass to collect materials to create even more powerful tools. *Simple* alien creatures will occasionally come out to slow the player’s progress.
